# Using Time Series Models for Defect Prediction in Software Release Planning
This Git repo contains the thesis work for my Master's degree in Computational Science. For an in-depth look at the work being done here, see the [proposal](proposal/proposal.pdf) document.

## Directory Organization
* _data_ - Data collection, extraction, and cleansing. First issue tracking data is collected manually from JIRA as XML documents. Then, using Python scripts, issue data is extracted from the XML, cleansed, and saved into text table format for later processing in R scripts. For more details about this process, see the Data Methodology section in the [proposal](proposal/proposal.pdf) document.
* _modeling_ - R scripts for time series data sampling, stationarity testing, model specification & estimation, model diagnostics checking, and model selection. For more details about this process, see the Data Methodology and Modeling Methodology sections in the [proposal](proposal/proposal.pdf) document.
* _proposal_ - Thesis proposal document being generated by LaTeX files. Describes all facets of the thesis: introduction, motivation, background, methodology, and results (so far).
